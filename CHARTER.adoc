 . *Mission of the TODO Group (“TODO”).*
 The TODO Group’s mission is to identify key policy and process choices related to corporate open source engagement and create tools and educational materials that promote best practices around such engagements.
 . *Membership*
The TODO Group membership is composed of individuals deeply involved in running open source programs setup to drive open source across divisions and product lines within their company. These individuals have learned from practical experience what it takes to successfully engage in or create open source projects and build effective internal open source programs that guide how developers in their company engage in external communities. +
The TODO Group shall be composed of the General Members and a Steering Committee. Anyone may participate as a General Member as long as they meet the General Member Qualifications. At such time as a General Member no longer meets the qualifications, their General Member status will be rescinded.
 .. General Member Qualifications: An individual may be qualified to join TODO Group as a General Member if they:
 ... Are an employee of an organization with development teams that use or contribute to open source projects across multiple divisions, products, or departments,
 ... in a role that manages, oversees, or guides the organization’s policies and contributions to open source projects (an “Open Source Program Office”),
 ... and the organization does not derive a significant portion of its revenue as a solution provider to other OSPOs. +
 .. General Members shall be entitled to:
 ... Participate in TODO Group Working Groups, meetings, initiatives, events and any other activities;
 ... identify their company as a member or participant in the TODO Group; and
 ... nominate one individual for election to the Steering Committee.
 . *Steering Committee*
 .. Responsibility: The Steering Committee shall be responsible for:
 ... coordinating with the group's Program Manager to manage day-to-day operations of the group;

 ... approving procedures for the nomination and election of any officer or other positions created by the Steering Committee;

 ... Elected committee member terms shall begin on January 1st of the year following election, and terminate on December 31st of the second year following election.
 ... Appointed committee member terms shall begin on the first day of the month after their appointment, and terminate on the last day of the month exactly 24 months after their appointment, unless the appointment is to replace a departed member as detailed below. For example, a typical appointed term will be February 1st for term start and January 31st two years later for term end.
 ... In each calendar year, the group shall hold an election to fill elected positions which will be vacated at the end of that year. The election process shall include nominations and voting no earlier than during the month of September and no later than during the month of November.
 ... In each calendar year, the committee shall appoint one (1) member to fill the appointed position which will be vacated that year. The appointment shall be made in January immediately after the start of the term for new elected members, by the current members of the committee at that time.
 ... In even-numbered years, two (2) elected positions and one (1) appointed position shall be filled by the election and appointment processes.
 ... In odd-numbered years, three (3) elected positions and one (1) appointed position shall be filled by the election and appointment processes.
 ... If any committee member should resign or otherwise be unable to complete their term for any reason, with more than six (6) months remaining in their term, the remaining committee members shall appoint a replacement member. For election or appointment purposes, that member's term will end when the outgoing member's term would have ended.
 ... If any committee member should resign or otherwise be unable to complete their term for any reason, with six (6) months or fewer remaining in their term, their position will be left unfilled until the regularly scheduled election or appointment process for that position.
 ... Elections shall be run using the Condorcet-IRV method through the Cornell online service (+++<u>+++http://civs.cs.cornell.edu/+++</u>+++). The methodology or service used in future elections may be changed via a five (5) member approval vote of current members of the committee at that time.
