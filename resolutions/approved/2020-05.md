# TODO Group Steering Committee
## Resolution 2020-05
## Status: Approved on 2020-12-11

## Subject: Suggested changes for Steering Committee member selection

In the Slack channel for the Steering Committee of the TODO Group, as well as in [Pull Request #90](https://github.com/todogroup/governance/pull/90) in the TODO Group Governance repo, the committee reviewed and adopted the following resolution:

We will amend the [organisation charter](https://github.com/todogroup/governance/blob/master/CHARTER.adoc) to clarify the dates and timings of the election and terms of both elected and appointed steering committee members. A summary of the proposed changes:

* Specify appointed member terms start on February 1 and last 2 years
* Provide more flexibility in the nomination/election timing (Sept-Nov
instead of Sept only)
* Specify appointments happen at start of year after newly elected
member terms begin

The proposed changes to the charter are in commit 112872ee1db230c2228c56acfe264a35f976efff, contained in Pull Request #90.

Resolved:

WHEREAS, the charter of the TODO Group, dated 2020-11-16, empowers the Steering Committee to amend the organisation charter with a two-thirds majority of all now-serving Steering Committee members;

the committee approves the proposed action.
